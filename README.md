# Covid-19-Station-Box

Currently, there is a worldwide outbreak of the Covid-19 virus which has impacted many aspects of the environment and living things. For example, the economy has slowed down, education has become more difficult to access due to the need for online learning equipment, which many families cannot support. There are also restrictions on travel, both domestic and international, and the most significant impact has been on health. Covid-19 is a respiratory disease that can cause symptoms such as chest tightness, difficulty breathing, fatigue, dizziness, and diarrhea. Some people may show no symptoms while others may experience severe symptoms. If infected with Covid-19, it can affect the lungs, heart, brain blood vessels, as well as body temperature and oxygen levels, which can be very dangerous if the infected person does not show clear symptoms and is unaware they are infected.

As a result of the above problem, the creators decided to develop the Covid Station Box to help detect and screen individuals with Covid-19 who may not show symptoms through body temperature, heart rate, and oxygen levels screening.

## Workflow

The workflow of the Covid Station Box involves using body temperature sensors to measure temperature, heart rate sensors to measure heart rate, and oxygen sensors to measure oxygen levels in the blood. Users are instructed to touch the sensors with their fingers and the system displays the results on an LCD screen. The system can be activated using a keypad and sends results and notifications via the Line application.
